# Rust Rider

*An exploratory clone of Line Rider.*

Rust Rider is a sandbox-style game where players build courses for their
character to ride. The player's only building block in creating their courses
are line segments. These segments can be of any length, orientation, or
quantity. Together they comprise a course that the character, propelled by
gravity, can ride.
